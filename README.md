# pool-controller
Control pool equipment with raspberry pi and arduino

bin dir does the work

www controls the UI stuff

-----------------------------

Insert sdcard into writer or slot
Download the Raspberry Pi installer:
https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/imager/imager.exe
Install, then choose:
Raspbian, and your SD Card

Or:
On Windows requires 7zip

Download Rapbian with desktop and recommended software:
https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_full_latest

Use 7zip to extract the image (img file)

Download Win32DiskImager:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/
Run win32diskimager
Select the extracted file and choose Write

--------------------------

Insert sdcard into raspberry pi and start it up
You'll need the UI:

Set a new password in the setup program

Do the local stuff ( keyboard, language, etc... )

Setup WIFI

Choose next to update software, then restart.  Had to go back to run again, once. Then reboot and try again...

--------------------------------

Get the IP address, and mac address:
ifconfig -a

You need this because we won't be using the desktop anymore.  You will need to add this mac address to your router as a static IP.  I cannot provide this documentation
